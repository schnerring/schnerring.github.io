The title of this guide is an homage to the pfSense baseline guide with VPN, Guest, and VLAN support that some of you guys might know, and this is an OPNsense migration of it. I found that guide two years ago and immediately fell in love with the network setup. After researching for weeks, I decided to use OPNsense instead of pfSense.</description></item><item><title>Router on a Stick VLAN Configuration with SwOS on the Mikrotik CRS328-24P-4S+RM Switch</title><link>https://schnerring.net/posts/router-on-a-stick-vlan-configuration-with-swos-on-the-mikrotik-crs328-24p-4s+rm-switch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 03:30:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://schnerring.net/posts/router-on-a-stick-vlan-configuration-with-swos-on-the-mikrotik-crs328-24p-4s+rm-switch/</guid><description>&lt;p>My homelab grew quite a bit over the past years. And with that, my networking needs also changed: stricter firewall rules, segregating untrusted IoT devices into separate networks, traffic prioritization, and more. I wanted to document my switch and VLAN configuration. And maybe this is useful for someone else, too.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
