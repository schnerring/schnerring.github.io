When I was a first grader in the mid-90s, I got my first Windows 95 computer as
a gift from my dad. Since then, I have been fascinated by computers and the
Internet, giving me access to an ever-expanding universe. I've lived throughout
the digital age since its dawn and I continue to be amazed at how technology is
shaping our world ever faster, for better and for worse.

With infinite amounts of information at my fingertips, I love discovering and
learning new things every day. I enjoy building (and breaking) tech to
efficiently solve real-world problems. When I'm on my own time, I sometimes like
over-engineering things just because I can. üöÄ

However, few soulless corporations control the Web. I actively sponsor and
contribute to open-source projects to make the WWW a more human and independent
place again. I strive to regain as much of my digital privacy as possible and
educate others by documenting my journey. But it's tough ‚Äî a constant balancing
act between convenience and nuisance, between being an advisor and being a
preacher, between being a cypherpunk and being a hypocrite.

On this website, I share my thoughts and notes about things that I'm excited
about and working on and hope to connect with people having a similar mindset.
I'd love to hear from you!

## Privacy

**I respect your privacy.**

I use [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) to collect anonymous web
analytics data to get insights into what content people enjoy and how they
discover it.
[All analytics data I collect is publicly accessible on the stats page](/stats).

When you leave a comment on my blog, the
[Remark42 commenting engine](https://remark42.com/) generally only stores the
user ID, username and avatar link. It requests and stores the minimum possible
scope from third-party authentication providers. Users may request and download
all their data from Remark42 and purge it completely by submitting a "Delete Me"
request.

## Sponsoring

**I do not offer advertisements or sponsorships** for any form of payment. I
author all the content on this blog and offer it for free as in free beer. All
recommendations I make are independent and unbiased.

**I do not use affiliate links for anything I recommend**. Affiliate links are
specific web links that reward the advertiser with commissions for visits,
signups, or sales through that link.

**I do not accept guest posts or sponsored content in any form.** I ignore all
such requests, so please don't contact me about that.
