When using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), we often
include steps that use Git to check out out the code of the repository, make
some changes to the code, and then commit these changes back to the repo.
Additional steps subsequently act upon these changes within the same workflow
run. For example, appending auto-generated release notes to a `CHANGELOG.md`
file and committing it to the repo, to later bundle the changelog with release
artifacts. Another example is using a workflow that periodically uses a linter
to clean up the code base. Simple enough, right?

## TL;DR

If you're just interested in the solution, I recommend using the following
snippet:

```yml
jobs:
  update-changelog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      commit_hash: ${{ steps.commit-and-push.outputs.commit_hash }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out the Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Update CHANGELOG.md
        run: echo "Added changes on $(date)" >> CHANGELOG.md

      - name: Commit and Push Changes
        id: commit-and-push
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4

  publish:
    needs: update-changelog
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the Repo Again
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ needs.update-changelog.outputs.commit_hash }}

      - name: Display CHANGELOG.md
        run: |
          # The changes are here ðŸŽ‰
          cat CHANGELOG.md
```

## The Issue

When recently trying to implement this, I came up with the following
(simplified) solution:

```yml
# BAD CODE: DON'T USE!

jobs:
  update-changelog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Update CHANGELOG.md
        run: echo "Added changes on $(date)" >> CHANGELOG.md

      - name: Commit and Push Changes
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4

  publish:
    needs: update-changelog
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the Repo Again
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Display CHANGELOG.md
        run: |
          # The changes are missing ðŸ˜•
          cat CHANGELOG.md
```

As you can see, there are two jobs: `update-changelog` and `publish`. By
default, jobs run in parallel. To ensure publishing only happens after updating
the changelog, we set `publish.needs` to `update-changelog`.

The `update-changelog` job checks out the code using the
[`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action, appends a
message containing the current date to the `CHANGELOG.md` file, and then uses
the
[`stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action`](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action)
action to commit and push the code to the repository.

In the `publish` job that follows, we check out the code again and inspect the
contents of our changelog file, only to find out that the changes we made are
missing.

I have fallen into this trap numerous times, and since you are reading this, it
is likely that you have, too. We are not alone! I came across a
[popular GitHub issue from the `actions/checkout` action repository](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/439)
where people share the same pain.
